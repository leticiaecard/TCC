ABSTRACT

This work refers to the project and development of an instrumentation circuit that can be used on lifting platforms by a telescopic system as a substitute for the ladder for maintenance activities in the electrical network to provide safety and reduce physical effort to professionals are going to use it. The platform has insulation for 1,000 volts, a maximum load capacity of 130 kg and a maximum elevation to 5.5 meters. This way, it is proposed to monitor the load and stability of the system, as well as to control the activation of the displacement and elevation motors by the specific operation modes of the set. Afterwards, in the first stage of the validation phase, bench tests were carried out on the four projectâ€™s modules. Finally, the second stage comprised the construction of the prototype and its field tests to ensure its correct operation in real conditions.

Key-words: Instrumentation circuit, lifting platform, work safety, Arduino, embedded programming, monitoring, microcontroller, prototype.
